## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router) with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS; avoid CSS-in-JS
- Components: Server Components by default; Client Components only when needed (animations, forms)
- State: React Context only; avoid additional global state libraries
- Forms: Native HTML validation; submissions via mailto or third-party (if approved); no custom server
- Content: Static content (MDX/JSON) for all pages; CMS out of scope per rules
- Images: `next/image` with responsive sizes and lazy loading
- SEO: Next.js Metadata API (OpenGraph, Twitter)
- Analytics: Google Analytics 4
- Deployment: GitHub Pages via static export; custom domain with SSL (GitHub Pages)
- Constraints: Keep dependencies minimal; do not add new libraries outside this stack without approval

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Content Creation Timeline** - Mitigation: Start content creation early, use placeholders
2. **Performance Requirements** - Mitigation: Implement performance monitoring from day one

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Animation Performance** - Mitigation: Use hardware acceleration, test on lower-end devices
2. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Mitigation: Mobile-first development approach
3. **SEO Implementation** - Mitigation: SEO framework setup early, regular testing
