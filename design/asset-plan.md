# Asset Plan (Week 2)

## Image Requirements

- Formats: WebP preferred; JPEG acceptable with quality ~75–85.
- Sizes: generate 640, 960, 1280, 1600, 1920 widths where relevant.
- Naming: kebab-case, descriptive (e.g., `ballet-portrait-01.jpg`).
- Location: `public/images/`.

## Video Planning (Hero)

- Duration: 8–20s loop, silent; include fallback poster.
- Encodes: MP4 (H.264) with reasonable bitrate; provide image fallback/slideshow for older devices.

## Icons & Illustration

- Simple line icons for services/process; SVG only.

## Photography Style Guide

- Natural light, warm tones, airy backgrounds; candid movement; no heavy filters.

## Workflow

- Collect assets → rename to kebab-case → compress → export responsive sizes → update `design/image-manifest.md`.
